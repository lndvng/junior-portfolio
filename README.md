# Junior-Portfolio

## Description
My motivation for this was to create a portfolio website so that I can showcase to potentional employers. I built this portfolio website so that employers can get to know a little bit about me, view projects I have worked on, and have access to my contact information. I learned how to create elements and connect styles from the CSS to these HTML elements using class and ID's, how to create a clickable image that deployed a link in a new tab, how to create functional contact links.
